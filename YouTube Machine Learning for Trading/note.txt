Examples of machine learning in trading
- Supervised Learning
-- Singal generation through prediction. For example, buy or sell signals based on predicted returns or direction.
-- Risk management through prediction. For example, determining position sizing and stop-loss levels to have more optimized risk.
- Unsupervised Learning
-- Extract insights from the data. For example, discover patterns, relationships and structures.

Challenges to applying machine learning in trading
- Reflexivity: if you found a good method and applied it, over time, others will notice that and take similar action, then the good method will no longer work.
- Hard to predict returns or prices, return signs, economic indicator.
- Not so hard to predict volatility.
- Technical: overfitting and generalization, non-stationarity and regime shifts, interpretation of black-box models.

Workflow:
1. Collect and prepare the data.
2. Develop a hypothesis for a strategy.
3. Coding the model.
4. Backtest the strategy.

Unsupervised learning
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Anomaly Detection
- Market Regime Detection
- Portfolio Optimization
